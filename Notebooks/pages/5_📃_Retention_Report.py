**Retention Actions:**
- Offer **age-based loyalty incentives**, such as senior-friendly plans or discounted renewals.

## 📱 Usage Frequency Optimization

Customers with **low activity levels** are more prone to churn, while those with consistent engagement remain loyal.

**Retention Actions:**
- Introduce **usage-based reminders or rewards** to encourage more frequent engagement.  
- Provide **onboarding tutorials or feature highlights** for low-frequency users to increase product familiarity.  
- Implement **personalized email or app notifications** when a customer’s activity level drops below average.

## ☎️ Customer Support Experience Enhancement

Frequent support calls are a strong early signal of dissatisfaction — customers making **more than 5 calls** are at very high risk of churn.

**Retention Actions:**
- Improve **first-call resolution rates** through better training and more empowered support staff.  
- Deploy a **customer recovery workflow** that flags repeated callers for proactive outreach.  
- Implement **post-call follow-ups** to ensure the issue is genuinely resolved and satisfaction restored.

## 💼 Subscription and Contract Strategy

Customers with **monthly contracts** almost always churn, while longer-term contracts (annual or quarterly) reduce this risk.

**Retention Actions:**
- Promote **discounted long-term contracts** to encourage commitment.  
- Offer **easy upgrade options** from monthly to annual plans with incentives (e.g., one free month).  
- Highlight the **value stability** of longer contracts in marketing campaigns.

## 💰 Spending Behavior and Payment Discipline

Customers spending **over \$600** are significantly less likely to churn, suggesting higher-value users have stronger brand trust.  
However, **extreme payment delays** are a warning signal, often preceding churn.

**Retention Actions:**
- Identify **mid-tier customers** near the \$600 spending threshold and encourage them to upgrade via reward programs.  
- Use **automated alerts** for delayed payments beyond 20 days and offer flexible payment options before churn occurs.  
- Launch **“thank you” programs** for high-value customers to reinforce satisfaction and loyalty.

## 🤝 Engagement and Relationship Management

Customers who interact less frequently or go long periods without activity are much more likely to churn.

**Retention Actions:**
- Deploy **automated re-engagement campaigns** targeting inactive users with reminders or special offers.  
- Use **personalized communication** (e.g., “We miss you” emails or in-app messages) to revive engagement.  
- Track recent interactions and set up **risk alerts** for accounts showing declining usage or communication.
